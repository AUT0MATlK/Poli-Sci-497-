What research question do you want to answer?

What are modern opinions of hard drug decriminalization?

What are two possible answers?

It's either going to be there is positive opinions. 
Or there are negative opinions of hard drug decriminilization

What are the documents of text data you will analyze?

I would analyze social media posts, trending hashtags or modern academia opinions and analyze the documents for positive opinions. 


Give two examples of documents in the corpus that you expect will be high in similarity to each other? Two examples that are *low* in similarity?


I think academia documents will both be rather positive and view decriminalization in a good way. While social media documents will differ quite a bit due to the wide range of opinions and backgrounds.
